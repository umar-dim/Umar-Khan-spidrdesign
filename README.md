# Umar Khan Spidr Coding Challange

## Task

1. Create a simple React app that contains a single-page form with the following fields:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Phone Number
- Email Address
- Guess the Air Fryer’s Cost (dollar amount)
- A very, very secret 16-digit Spidr PIN
  - Digits are formatted with dashes in groups of four: ####-####-####-####.

2. There should be a submit button at the bottom of the form.

  - This doesn’t need to do anything meaningful—just print the user’s form data to the console.
